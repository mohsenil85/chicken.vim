apropos = ,a  (ie, ,wtf ormap)
docs = ,K (ie, ,doc (list-utils ormap)
fn completion
display args list for fn = ,g (?)

docs, second order docs (ie, docs in docs)  (meh)
debug, trace
prompt to load namespace ("use")
propt to apropos
prompt to search docs
prompt to install package

,c = connect to repl
,d = eval defun
,b = bugger
,s = line, or selected (not too worried about)

also a skeleton proj would be nicish
