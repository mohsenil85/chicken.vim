apropos = ,a  (ie, ,wtf ormap)
x docs = ,K (ie, ,doc (list-utils ormap)
fn completion
display args list for fn = ,g (?)

x docs, second order docs (ie, docs in docs)  (meh)
x trace
dubug (?)  
x prompt to load namespace ("use")
x propt to apropos
x prompt to search docs
x prompt to install package

,c = connect to repl
,d = eval defun
,b = buffer
,s = line, or selected (not too worried about)
,a = wtf at cursor (or selected, not implemeted yet)
,K = doc lookup at cursor or selected
,H = doc into repel (should kill this)
,i = install chicken package
,n = prompt load namspace into repl
,h = visually selected doc into repel (should kill)
,t = trace fn
,f = prompt search for docs 
,e = eval innermost paren (as opposed to ,d which grabs outermost)
,E = send lisp directly to repl (good for dumping vars, etc)

todo
make ,a output search terms into buffer like ,K
make the prompt commands be public like ":ChickenDocInstall"
arglist completion, slimv style (echom)

possibly view compiled output? ,l
get error messages from csc
